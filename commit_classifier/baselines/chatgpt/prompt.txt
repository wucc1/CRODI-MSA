Please act as a commit classifier,
categorize git commit into three categories: Adaptive, Perfective, and Corrective.
The Adaptive category corresponds to commits that address the modifications to the project in order to adapt it to the new environment such as the feature addition.
The Perfective category corresponds to commits that address enhancement of the project, such as enhancement of performance and refactoring of source code.
The Corrective category corresponds to commits that address the fix of bugs and faults in the project.
I will provide you with the commit message and code diff for a commit,
and you need to give me the category label for this commit.
Please avoid any explanations and only provide the category label.
